## Installation

Make sure to run 'npm i' to install all of the dependencies in the package.json file. This app uses Express, Moment (for timestamp), and Mongoose.

## Usage

You can seed users by going to the POST user endpoint in Insomnia (http://localhost:3001/api/users) and populating it with sample data in the following JSON structure:

```
{
  "username": "lernantino4",
  "email": "lernantino4@gmail.com"
}
```

You can then do a get request to see your sample user data (http://localhost:3001/api/users). You can also get data by User ID as well (http://localhost:3001/api/users/:userIDhere).

PUT and DELETE for users is also supported.

POST thoughts by usiing a valid userID (http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts/:useridhere) in the below format:

```
{
  "thoughtText": "Here's another cool thought 4...",
	"username": "lernantino4"
}
```

GET all current thoughts via http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts. You can also get thoughts by their id.

PUT and DELETE for thoughts is also supported.

POST reactions by using a valid thoughtID (Example: http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts/64b18e4ffed373230ca97abc/reactions) and populate the body of the request with sample JSON like below.
